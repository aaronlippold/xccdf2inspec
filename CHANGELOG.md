# Change Log

## [1.1.0]
  - Added Benchmark info to the top of the output and thusly added support for
    references and Profile level data when the objects support it.
  - Clean some of the string `puts` so they were less complex and done
    in a more ruby like fashion.
  - Added a CHANGELOG.md file
  - Fixed and standardized much of the YARD docs so they should now all be
    accurate. 

## [1.0.1]
  - adding some documentation, fixing some errors in the comments and
    just doing general cleanup for easier use.
