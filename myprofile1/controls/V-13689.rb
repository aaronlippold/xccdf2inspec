conditions, and problems are the access and error logs. In the event of a
security incident, these logs can provide the SA and the web administrator with
valuable information. Because of the information that is captured in the logs,
it is critical that only authorized individuals have access to the logs."

Determine permissions for log files, from the command line: cd to the directory
where the log files are located and enter the command:

ls â€“al *log and note the owner and group permissions on these files. Only the
Auditors, Web Managers, Administrators, and the account that runs the web
server should have permissions to the files.

If any users other than those authorized have read access to the log files,
