  title "Each readable web document directory must contain either a default,
home, index, or equivalent file."
  desc  "The goal is to completely control the web users experience in
navigating any portion of the web document root directories. Ensuring all web
content directories have at least the equivalent of an index.html file is a
significant factor to accomplish this end. Also, enumeration techniques, such
as URL parameter manipulation, rely upon being able to obtain information about
the web serverâ€™s directory structure by locating directories with default
pages. This practice helps ensure that the anonymous web user will not obtain
directory browsing information or an error message that reveals the server type
and version."
