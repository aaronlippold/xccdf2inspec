# README - Test Data

The XCCDF to InSpec Parser scans and extracts the Controls defined in the
DISA XCCDF STIG XML documents and converts them into InSpec controls to
help make writting InSpec profiles based on the controls defined in DISA
STIG documents. 

The parser requires two files:
1. The XCCDF XML file - http://iase.disa.mil/stigs/Pages/a-z.aspx
2. the CCI XML file: 
  a. Info: http://iase.disa.mil/stigs/cci/Pages/index.aspx
  b. File: http://iasecontent.disa.mil/stigs/zip/u_cci_list.zip

All test data has been produced by DISA. For any information or questions, please contact IASE.
